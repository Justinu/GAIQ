00:00:04,993 --> 00:00:04,993
Use the Calendar to set your active date range C the time period for which you want to look at data.
使用日历设置有效日期范围-你想要查看的时间范围

2
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Select date ranges by clicking on the day and month within the calendar or you can type dates in the “Date Range” boxes.

3
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Once you set a date range, it stays active until you change it, or log out.

4
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can use a comparison date range to see how your site is performing month over month, year over year or even from one day to another.

5
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
The date range and comparison date ranges you select will apply to all your reports and graphs.

6
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Most reports include an over-time graph at the top. You can make this graph display data by day, week, or month.

7
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can attach short notes or annotations to specific dates. Annotations are especially useful when you’re looking at historical data and wondering whether certain campaigns or outside events had some effect on your traffic.

8
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
To add an annotation, just click the date on the graph and select “Create new annotation”.

9
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can allow anyone with access to the profile to see the annotation, or make it private so that only you see it.

10
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Most reports include an over-time graph at the top. You can make this graph display data by day, week, or month.

11
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can attach short notes or annotations to specific dates. Annotations are especially useful when you’re looking at historical data and wondering whether certain campaigns or outside events had some effect on your traffic.

12
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
To add an annotation, just click the date on the graph and select “Create new annotation”.

13
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can allow anyone with access to the profile to see the annotation, or make it private so that only you see it.

14
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
A metric is a measurement. Examples of metrics are “number of visits”, “pages viewed per visit”, and “average time on site”.

15
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Metrics appear in scorecards and as columns in tables.

16
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Metrics can also be graphed.

17
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can graph any metric in a scorecard, simply by clicking it. Here, we’ve graphed Average Time on Site.

18
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can compare two metrics on the same graph to see how they are correlated.

19
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Click Compare Metric and select from the drop down.

20
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
In this example, we’re adding Average Time on Site to the graph.

21
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Groups of metrics are organized into tabs.

22
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
The Site Usage tab shows metrics such as the number of pages viewed per visit, the average time on site, and the bounce rate.

23
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Goal Set tabs shows the conversion rates for each of your goals.

24
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
If you’ve enabled ecommerce, you’ll also see an Ecommerce tab.

25
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
The AdWords reports have an additional tab called Clicks. This tab contains AdWords related metrics such as clicks, cost, revenue per click and ROI.

26
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
The AdSense tab contains AdSense metrics such as revenue from AdSense and AdSense ads clicked.

27
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Many reports contain tables. These tables usually break out your data by a single dimension.

28
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Each row in the table shows the data for a different value of the dimension.

29
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
In this example, the dimension being shown is City. Each row contains the data for a different city.

30
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Each row in this table corresponds to a kind of browser C Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and so on.

31
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
So, this table is showing data for different values of the dimension “Browser”.

32
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
The Viewing option above the table lets us change the dimension. If we click Operating System as the Viewing Option, the table shows data for each kind of operating system.

33
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
We can also add a secondary dimension. This lets us see data for each combination of two dimensions.

34
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
In this example, the table shows data for each operating system.

35
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Let’s look at what happens if we select Browser as a secondary dimension.

36
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Now we can see data for each Operating System and Browser combination.

37
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
So, we can see data for Windows and Firefox, Windows and Chrome, Macintosh and Safari, Macintosh and Chrome, and so on.

38
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
To filter the data that appears in a table, click the Search option above the table.

39
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
In this example, we’re excluding visits from London and New York and also excluding any visits in which there were fewer than 2 pages viewed.

40
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
The View option lets you visualize data in different ways.

41
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
The Data view organizes your report data into a table. This is the default view for many reports.

42
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
The Percentage view creates a pie-chart based on any one of the metrics in the report.

43
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
The Performance view shows a bar-graph based on any metric you select.

44
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
The Comparison view allows you to quickly see whether each entry in the table is performing above or below average.

45
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Term Cloud helps you visualize your keywords.

46
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Pivot creates a pivot table in which both rows and columns can break out dimension values.

47
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
In this example, we can see how many visits were referred by each combination of keyword and search engine.

48
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Keywords are shown as rows and search engines are shown as columns.

49
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can select the metrics you want to display in the table and the dimensions.

50
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Columns within tables can be sorted in both ascending and descending order simply by clicking on the column heading.

51
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
The arrows next to the heading title indicate the order in which the results are listed.

52
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
A down arrow indicates descending order and an upward arrow indicates ascending order.

53
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
By default, all reports with tables display ten rows.

54
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
To display more than ten rows, go to the bottom of your report and click the dropdown menu arrow next to “Show rows”.

55
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can display up to 500 rows per page.

56
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
An advanced segment is a subset of your data.

57
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
For example, by selecting Visits with Transactions, you can limit your analysis to just the visits during which a person bought something.

58
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
If you apply a single advanced segment, all your reports are limited to the data in that segment until you select a different segment.

59
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can always go back to seeing all your data by selecting the All Traffic segment.

60
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
By default, all reports with tables display ten rows.

61
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
To display more than ten rows, go to the bottom of your report and click the dropdown menu arrow next to “Show rows”.

62
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can display up to 500 rows per page.

63
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
An advanced segment is a subset of your data.

64
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
For example, by selecting Visits with Transactions, you can limit your analysis to just the visits during which a person bought something.

65
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
If you apply a single advanced segment, all your reports are limited to the data in that segment until you select a different segment.

66
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can always go back to seeing all your data by selecting the All Traffic segment.

67
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
You can select up to four segments at a time. This allows you to compare data for each segment side by side as you go through your reports.

68
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
In this case, we’ve selected three segments: Visits with Transactions, Search Traffic, and Paid Search Traffic.

69
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
The Advanced Segment pulldown shows two kinds of segments: Default Segments and Custom Segments.

70
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Default Segments are predefined and available to anyone using Google Analytics.

71
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:15,414
Custom Segments are segments that you define. We’ll learn how to create custom segments in later lesson.
