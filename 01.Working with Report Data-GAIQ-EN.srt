1
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:10,156
使用日历设置有效的时间范围-你想要查看的时间范围

2
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:18,172
在日历中点击月日来选择日期范围 或者可以在“日期范围”中输入日期

3
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:22,952
设置的日期范围会一直生效至再次修改或退出

4
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:32,298
通过选择日期比较 你可以比较网站月 年甚至天的表现

5
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:38,173
日期范围和你所选择的比较日期范围将应用到所有的报告和图表

6
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:46,469
大多数报告顶部有一个时间折线图 你可以选择按天 周或月显示数据

7
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:59,796
你可以为特定日期添加小说明或注释 注释非常有用 尤其是当你查看历史数据 并且不知道特定广告活动或外部事件对流量是否有一些影响时

8
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:04,785
要添加一个注释 只需要点击图上的日期 并且选择“创建新注释”

9
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:12,235
你可以允许所有拥有配置文件访问权限的人看到注释 或者将注释设置隐私只有自己能看到

10
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:20,495
指标是一个度量 “访问次数” “每次访问的网页浏览量”和“平均访问持续时间”都是指标的例子

11
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,640
指标出现在积分卡中 也是表格中列

12
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:26,837
指标也会被画成图

13
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:34,108
你可以将积分卡中的任意指标转化为图 只需要点击这个指标 这里我们将平均访问持续时间转化为图

14
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:38,558
You can compare two metrics on the same graph to see how they are correlated.
你可以在一张图上比较两个指标 以便查看二者的关系

15
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:42,214
Click Compare Metric and select from the drop down.

16
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:46,388
In this example, we’re adding Average Time on Site to the graph.

17
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:49,671
Groups of metrics are organized into tabs.

18
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:57,077
The Site Usage tab shows metrics such as the number of pages viewed per visit, the average time on site, and the bounce rate.

19
00:01:57,356 --> 00:02:01,716
Goal Set tabs shows the conversion rates for each of your goals.

20
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:05,948
If you’ve enabled ecommerce, you’ll also see an Ecommerce tab.

21
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:17,452
The AdWords reports have an additional tab called Clicks. This tab contains AdWords related metrics such as clicks, cost, revenue per click and ROI.

22
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,058
The AdSense tab contains AdSense metrics such as revenue from AdSense and AdSense ads clicked.

23
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:30,639
Many reports contain tables. These tables usually break out your data by a single dimension.

24
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:34,994
Each row in the table shows the data for a different value of the dimension.

25
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:42,265
In this example, the dimension being shown is City. Each row contains the data for a different city.

26
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:49,857
Each row in this table corresponds to a kind of browser C Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and so on.

27
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:54,213
So, this table is showing data for different values of the dimension “Browser”.

28
00:02:55,298 --> 00:03:04,854
The Viewing option above the table lets us change the dimension. If we click Operating System as the Viewing Option, the table shows data for each kind of operating system.

29
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:12,028
We can also add a secondary dimension. This lets us see data for each combination of two dimensions.

30
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:16,153
In this example, the table shows data for each operating system.

31
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,420
Let’s look at what happens if we select Browser as a secondary dimension.

32
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:25,392
Now we can see data for each Operating System and Browser combination.

33
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:33,962
So, we can see data for Windows and Firefox, Windows and Chrome, Macintosh and Safari, Macintosh and Chrome, and so on.

34
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:39,965
To filter the data that appears in a table, click the Search option above the table.

35
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:47,983
In this example, we’re excluding visits from London and New York and also excluding any visits in which there were fewer than 2 pages viewed.

36
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:52,621
The View option lets you visualize data in different ways.

37
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:58,924
The Data view organizes your report data into a table. This is the default view for many reports.

38
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,876
The Percentage view creates a pie-chart based on any one of the metrics in the report.

39
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,900
The Performance view shows a bar-graph based on any metric you select.

40
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:16,775
The Comparison view allows you to quickly see whether each entry in the table is performing above or below average.

41
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,682
Term Cloud helps you visualize your keywords.

42
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:26,200
Pivot creates a pivot table in which both rows and columns can break out dimension values.

43
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:32,262
In this example, we can see how many visits were referred by each combination of keyword and search engine.

44
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,153
Keywords are shown as rows and search engines are shown as columns.

45
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:40,180
You can select the metrics you want to display in the table and the dimensions.

46
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:47,774
Columns within tables can be sorted in both ascending and descending order simply by clicking on the column heading.

47
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:52,445
The arrows next to the heading title indicate the order in which the results are listed.

48
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:58,210
A down arrow indicates descending order and an upward arrow indicates ascending order.

49
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:01,916
By default, all reports with tables display ten rows.

50
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:09,186
To display more than ten rows, go to the bottom of your report and click the dropdown menu arrow next to “Show rows”.

51
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,086
You can display up to 500 rows per page.

52
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:15,835
An advanced segment is a subset of your data.

53
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:24,181
For example, by selecting Visits with Transactions, you can limit your analysis to just the visits during which a person bought something.

54
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:32,103
If you apply a single advanced segment, all your reports are limited to the data in that segment until you select a different segment.

55
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:37,136
You can always go back to seeing all your data by selecting the All Traffic segment.

56
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:43,918
You can select up to four segments at a time. This allows you to compare data for each segment side by side as you go through your reports.

57
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:53,625
In this case, we’ve selected three segments: Visits with Transactions, Search Traffic, and Paid Search Traffic.

58
00:05:54,606 --> 00:06:00,514
The Advanced Segment pulldown shows two kinds of segments: Default Segments and Custom Segments.

59
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:05,390
Default Segments are predefined and available to anyone using Google Analytics.

60
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:12,063
Custom Segments are segments that you define. We’ll learn how to create custom segments in later lesson.

61
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:12,063
