In Google Analytics, a visit¡ªor session¡ªis defined by 30 minutes of inactivity, or when a user quits the browser.

You can change the 30 minute default by calling setSessionCookieTimeout as shown in the slide.

Simply specify a new timeout value in milliseconds as the argument to _setSessionCookieTimeout().
By default, a conversion can be attributed to a campaign that is up to 6 months old.

But, if your business has a longer or shorter marketing campaign timeframe, you can change this value.
Just call _setCampaignCookieTimeout() and specify your new campaign length in milliseconds.

For example, let¡¯s say that you want to set a campaign length of 30 days.
To figure out the number of milliseconds that is, type ¡°30 days in milliseconds¡± into Google Search.
The search engine will give you the answer which you can plug into _setCampaignCookieTimeout(). 


Google Analytics attributes conversions to the campaign that most recently referred the visitor. 
For example, let¡¯s say that someone discovers your site by clicking one of your AdWords ads. 
Then, they come back to your site by clicking a banner ad that you¡¯ve tagged with campaign variables. This time, they convert to one of your goals.
By default, the banner ad will get the credit for the conversion, not the AdWords ad that originally referred them.
To change this behavior, you can tag all of your campaign links with utm_nooverride=1. 
If you do this consistently with all of your campaigns, Google Analytics will attribute conversions to the first referring campaign, instead of the most recent one.
Note that the utm_nooverride setting can be used in conjunction with autotagging.
Google Analytics automatically tracks referrals from over 30 search engines. 
But, if you want to add a search engine, you can do it by calling _addOrganic() in your Google Analytics Tracking Code.
First, perform a search in the search engine and look at the URL of the search results page. 
In the URL, look for the keyword you searched -- it should be preceded by a letter and an equal sign. This letter is the query variable for the search engine.
In the example, the query variable is ¡°p¡±.
Add a call to _addOrganic in your Google Analytics Tracking Code. The first argument is the name of the search engine. The second argument is the query variable.
You may wish to treat traffic that results from certain search keywords as Direct. 
For example, if someone searches for the exact name of your site, you might want to treat that visit as a Direct visit instead of a search.
To do this, simply add a call to _addIgnoredOrganic() in your Google Analytics Tracking Code. Specify the keyword as the argument.
You can also treat referrals from certain sites as Direct traffic instead of as referrals.
For each site that you want to exclude as a referral and treat as Direct, add a call to _addIgnoredRef() in your Google Analytics Tracking Code.
Specify the name of the site as the argument.
