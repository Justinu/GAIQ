Two reports in the Content section focus on page traffic, but each report organizes it differently. 

The Pages report lists each page that received traffic.

The Page Title viewing option on the Pages report groups your pages according to Title tag. You can click on a title to see the pages that share that title.

The Content Drilldown report groups pages according to directory. You can click on a directory to see the pages in the directory.

The Landing Pages report lists all of the pages through which people entered your site. 

You can use this report to monitor the number of bounces and the bounce rate for each landing page. 

Bounce rate is good indicator of landing page relevance and effectiveness. 

You can lower bounce rates by tailoring each landing page to its associated ads and referral links. 

The more relevant the page, the less likely a visitor will be to bounce.



 The Navigation Summary can help you understand how people move through your site.
It shows how people arrived at a specific page and where they went afterwards.  

The report is available from the Pages report. 
Here¡¯s the Navigation Summary report.

Percent Entrances shows how frequently the page was a landing page. 

Percent Previous Pages shows how frequently visitors came to the page after viewing another page on the site. 

Percent Exits shows how frequently visits ended on this page. 

Percent Next Pages shows how frequently visitors continued on to another page on the site. 

The list of pages that were viewed immediately before the page or pages is shown in the left column, under Previous Page Path.

The list of pages that were viewed immediately after the page or pages is shown in the right column, under Destination Page.
